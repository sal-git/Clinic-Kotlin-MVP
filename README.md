# Clinic-Kotlin-MVP
A dummy clinic app to test MVP and Kotlin. User is able to edit some characteristics and add appointments.

I wanted to test Realm a little more in Kotlin. This project uses the Model View Presenter architecture. 
I added some callbacks to simulate network time in the interface. 

Kotlin is a fun langauge!!
